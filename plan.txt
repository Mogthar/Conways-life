need to redo the way mutated cells mutate - rather than going throughall mutated cells go through all non-mutants and determine how many mutants are around
That way one cell isnt treated twice 
But how to trat directionality?

Update the random grid generation such that one can bias it towards one or the other species (alive/dead) so that we dont begin with a screen halffilled with alive cells
